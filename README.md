Assignment for zolve internship

The following is my django implementation for a e-wallet, I have attached a requirements.txt and documentation for requests.  
The code should run after setting up django and django-restframework.  
Race conditions are implicitly handled as the dataBases that are supporeted in django have concurrency control , additionally ATOMICITY has been set to true in  
Django itself.
